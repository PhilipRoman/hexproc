= Hexproc

Hexproc is a hexadecimal preprocessor for building hex and binary files.
See the link:doc/hexproc.adoc[manual] for more information.

Hexproc is written in Lua and has no other required runtime dependencies.

== Build

Runing `make` will produce a standalone Lua script `hexproc`. Copy it wherever
you want.

Dependencies:

	* `make` (tested on GNU make)
	* `cpp` (tested on GCC C preprocessor)
	* `lua5.x` (tested on Lua5.3 but should be compatible with others)

Optional dependencies

	* For building documentation: `asciidoctor`
	* For checking Lua code: `luacheck`
	* To enable internal type checking: `luarocks` with package `checks`

== Documentation

Running `make docs` will generate documentation. `asciidoctor` is required
to build the documentation. Alternatively, just read the AsciiDoc source
under `doc/`.
